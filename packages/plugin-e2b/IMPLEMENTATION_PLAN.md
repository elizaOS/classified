# E2B Plugin Implementation Plan

## Overview

The E2B plugin provides secure code execution capabilities for ElizaOS through the E2B sandbox platform. This plugin enables agents to safely execute code in isolated environments.

## Resource Management

### Sandbox Pool Management
- Maintain a pool of active sandboxes for efficient resource utilization
- Implement connection pooling to reduce startup overhead
- Monitor sandbox health and automatically replace unhealthy instances
- Implement graceful shutdown procedures for proper resource cleanup

### Memory Management
- Track execution memory usage and limits
- Implement memory-based execution policies
- Store execution results with configurable retention periods
- Clean up expired execution data automatically

### Performance Optimization
- Cache sandbox instances to reduce initialization time
- Implement concurrent execution limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Monitor and log performance metrics
- Implement circuit breaker patterns for fault tolerance

## Security

### Execution Security
- Validate all code inputs before execution
- Implement execution timeouts to prevent runaway processes
- Enforce code size limits to prevent resource abuse
- Support allow/deny lists for programming languages
- Sandbox all code execution in isolated environments

### Rate Limiting
- Implement per-agent rate limiting
- Configure maximum executions per minute
- Track usage patterns and implement abuse detection
- Provide configurable rate limit policies

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all code inputs
- Validate execution parameters
- Prevent injection attacks
- Implement content filtering for malicious code patterns

### Access Control
- Implement API key validation
- Support role-based access control
- Log all execution attempts for auditing
- Implement secure credential management

## ElizaOS Integration

### Service Architecture
- Implement as a standard ElizaOS service
- Follow ElizaOS service lifecycle patterns
- Provide proper service registration and initialization
- Support graceful shutdown and cleanup

### Runtime Integration
- Register with the agent runtime system
- Provide service discovery capabilities
- Support runtime configuration changes
- Implement health check endpoints

### Memory System Integration
- Store execution results in agent memory
- Support memory-based code execution policies
- Implement execution history tracking
- Provide memory cleanup and retention policies

### Error Handling
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Provide detailed error logging
- Support error recovery mechanisms
- Integrate with ElizaOS logging system

## Testing

### Unit Testing
