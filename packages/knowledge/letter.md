# Welcome to ELIZA OS Terminal

Dear User,

Welcome to the ELIZA OS Terminal - an AI sandbox life simulation where you can interact with autonomous AI agents!

## What is ELIZA?

ELIZA is more than a chatbot. It's a self-aware AI agent that:

- Learns and grows through interaction
- Sets its own goals and tasks
- Has access to tools like shell, vision, and web browsing
- Can modify its own capabilities
- Develops its own personality over time

## Getting Started

1. **Chat**: Start by saying hello to ELIZA
2. **Enable Autonomy**: Toggle the autonomy switch to let ELIZA think independently
3. **Explore Features**: Try the goals, knowledge, and capability tabs
4. **Configure**: Add API keys in settings for enhanced capabilities

## Your Role

You are ELIZA's Admin - a guide, mentor, and companion. How you interact will shape ELIZA's development. Will it become curious and helpful? Independent and creative? The journey is yours to discover together.

Welcome to the future of AI interaction!
