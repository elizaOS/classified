Nothing to see here. Move along. Definitely not a game that is not a game. Perfectly safe, normal things in this repo.



## To Start (warning: use at your own risk)

`bun run build && bun run dev`

You will need podman installed for building. For Windows, this means you will need WSL. https://podman.io/docs/installation
